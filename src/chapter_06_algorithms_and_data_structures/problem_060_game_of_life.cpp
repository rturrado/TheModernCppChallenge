// The Game of Life
//
// Write a program that implements the Game of Life cellular automaton proposed by John Horton Conway.
// The universe of this game is a grid of square cells that could have one of two states: dead or alive.
// Every cell interacts with its adjacent neighbors, with the following transactions occurring on every step:
//
// - Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
// - Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
// - Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
// - Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
//
// The status of the game on each iteration should be displayed to the console,
// and for convenience, you should pick a reasonable size, such as 20 rows x 50 columns.
