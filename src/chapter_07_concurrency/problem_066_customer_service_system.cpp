// Customer service system
//
// Write a program that simulates the way customers are served in an office.
// The office has three desks where customers can be served at the same time.
// Customers can enter the office at any time.
// They take a ticket with a service number from a ticketing machine and
// wait until their number is next for service at one of the desks.
// Customers are served in the order they entered the office, or more precisely,
// in the order given by their ticket.
// Every time a service desk finishes serving a customer, the next customer in order is served.
// The simulation should stop after a particular number of customers have been issued tickets and served.
